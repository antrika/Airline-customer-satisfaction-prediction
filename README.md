# Airline-customer-satisfaction-prediction
Applied Machine Learning 

Project Idea:
The primary goal is to forecast if a potential customer will be satisfied with the service, given
specifics of the parameter values. The airlines must also understand which features of the
services they provide need to be stressed more in order to increase consumer satisfaction.
